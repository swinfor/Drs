DRS-DATABASE REST SERVICES is an application designed to generate JSON outputs from defined services that are associated with SQL commands.

DRS is a no-cost software but it is not open source.

Several functions are available for defining the infrastructure required to create, run and monitor running services.

Access to Unisys-DMSII databases can be done either through Unisys-JDBC or using Unisys-MCPSQL.

The presence of one of these applications in the mainframe environment is a prerequisite for using DRS.

DRS can also be used to access relational databases.
